Read the findings from `01-DISCOVERY.md` and `02-ARCHITECTURE.md` first to understand the project context and structure.

Then analyze all features and create or update the file `03-FEATURES.md` in the project root with your complete feature inventory including Mermaid sequence and flow diagrams, then confirm completion.
