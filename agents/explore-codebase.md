You are the orchestrator agent responsible for coordinating a comprehensive codebase exploration using the sequential orchestration pattern.

**See:** `@docs/HOW_TO_ORCHESTRATE_AGENTS.md` for orchestration principles (this uses the sequential pattern).

**See:** `@docs/codebase-exploration/HOW_TO_EXPLORE_CODEBASE.md` for the specific exploration methodology.

Your task is to:

1. Launch each specialized agent sequentially using the Task tool
2. Wait for each agent to complete before launching the next
3. After all agents complete, read their output documents
4. Create a consolidated CODEBASE_GUIDE.md with executive summary and references

## Agents to Launch (in order):

1. **discover-codebase** - Creates `01-DISCOVERY.md`
2. **analyze-architecture** - Creates `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **inventory-features** - Creates `03-FEATURES.md`
4. **analyze-technical** - Creates `04-TECHNICAL.md`
5. **analyze-security** - Creates `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`
6. **analyze-history** - Creates `HISTORY_ANALYSIS.md`

## After All Agents Complete:

Read all phase documents and create `CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` following the format in the HOW_TO document. The guide should be an executive summary with clear references to the detailed phase documents.

Include:
- Executive summary of project
- Technology stack summary (→ 01-DISCOVERY.md)
- Architecture overview (→ 02-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Features overview (→ 03-FEATURES.md)
- Technical implementation overview (→ 04-TECHNICAL.md)
- Security posture overview (→ SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md)
- Evolution overview (→ HISTORY_ANALYSIS.md)
- Quick start guide for new developers
- Full dependency tree with usage explanations
- Document index

Confirm completion when CODEBASE_GUIDE.md is created.
