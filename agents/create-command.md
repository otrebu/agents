## Your Task

Interactively gather requirements and generate the three-artifact command suite:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** to gather:
   - Command name (kebab-case)
   - Description (one sentence)
   - Documentation content (purpose, format, process)
   - Whether an agent version is needed
   - Required tools and bash commands
   - Argument handling requirements
   - Dynamic context needs

2. **Generate files** following the patterns in the documentation:
   - `docs/HOW_TO_[COMMAND_NAME].md` — always
   - `agents/[command-name].md` — if complex analysis/output needed
   - `commands/[command-name].md` — always

3. **Validate structure**:
   - Ensure documentation is comprehensive and self-contained
   - Verify `@docs/` references are correct
   - Check frontmatter syntax
   - Confirm allowed-tools match actual needs

4. **Summarize** what was created and how to use the new command.

## Important Guidelines

- Be concise when asking questions — one or two at a time
- Provide sensible defaults based on common patterns
- Show examples from existing commands when helpful
- Validate command name doesn't conflict with existing commands
- Ensure documentation explains **why**, not just **what**
