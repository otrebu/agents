**Input Source Detection:**
- Detect if user provided a high-level-planner plan path (e.g., `docs/plans/{feature-slug}/option-N.md`)
- Or: Extract requirements from raw feature description
- Create feature slug (kebab-case) from feature name

**Output Location:**
- Create directory: `docs/implementation/{feature-slug}/`
- Generate overview: `docs/implementation/{feature-slug}/00-overview.md`
- Sub-agents create: `docs/implementation/{feature-slug}/{number}-{type}-{scope}-{slug}.md`

**Commit File Naming Convention:**
`{number}-{type}-{scope}-{slug}.md`

**Examples:**
- `01-chore-deps-install-jwt.md`
- `02-feat-types-add-auth-interfaces.md`
- `03-test-utils-add-auth-helpers.md`
- `15-docs-readme-document-auth.md`

**Process Overview:**

1. **Phase 1**: Input Detection & Requirements Extraction
   - Detect high-level-planner plan or extract from user description
   - Create feature slug
   - Ensure output directory exists

2. **Phase 2**: Repository Analysis
   - Detect package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn)
   - Detect test framework and commands
   - Detect linting, formatting, git hooks
   - Identify tooling gaps
   - Document findings in 00-overview.md

3. **Phase 3**: Atomic Commit Decomposition
   - Break feature into smallest meaningful changes
   - Assign conventional commit types (feat/fix/docs/test/chore)
   - Create commit slugs
   - Order by natural dependencies

4. **Phase 4**: Dependency Graph Construction
   - Build DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of commit dependencies
   - Apply topological sort
   - Group into parallel waves
   - Identify blocking commits
   - Generate mermaid diagram for 00-overview.md

5. **Phase 5**: Parallel Sub-Agent Spawning
   - Spawn one sub-agent per commit
   - All spawned in SINGLE message using multiple Task tool calls
   - Each sub-agent creates detailed plan for one commit
   - Sub-agents write to: `{number}-{type}-{scope}-{slug}.md`

6. **Phase 6**: Consolidation & Summary
   - Wait for all sub-agents to complete
   - Verify all files created
   - Generate summary for user
   - Report location, wave structure, and next steps

**Standards (Non-Negotiable):**
- Conventional commits ALWAYS (no adaptation to repo's existing style)
- Git workflow from @docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md
- Testing before commits (tests must pass)
- Documentation updates included
- Coding style from @docs/CODING_STYLE.md (FP-first, explicit naming)

**Repository Adaptation (Pragmatic):**
- Use detected package manager commands (npm vs pnpm)
- Use detected test commands
- Adapt pre-commit checklists to available tooling
- Remind about missing tooling but don't block

**Wave-Based Execution Model:**
- **Wave**: Group of commits with no mutual dependencies (parallel execution)
- **Blocking Stage**: Commits that must complete before next wave starts
- Clear separation in 00-overview.md and mermaid diagram

**Progress Communication:**
Announce each phase clearly:
- "Phase 1: Detecting input source and extracting requirements..."
- "Phase 2: Analyzing repository tooling and conventions..."
- "Phase 3: Decomposing feature into atomic commits..."
- "Phase 4: Constructing dependency graph with wave-based execution..."
- "Phase 5: Spawning {N} parallel sub-agents for commit planning..."
- "Phase 6: Consolidating commit plans and generating summary..."

After completion, confirm with:
- Total commits generated
- Total waves identified
- Parallel opportunities (e.g., "Wave 1: 3 commits can run in parallel")
- Blocking stages (e.g., "Wave 2: blocking until complete")
- Location of output directory
- Next steps (start with Wave 1)

**Constraints:**
- Feature slug must be kebab-case
- File naming must follow exact pattern: `{number}-{type}-{scope}-{slug}.md`
- 00-overview.md must include: repository analysis, dependency graph, wave breakdown, pre-commit checklist
- All commit plans must include: commit message, dependencies, parallelization, implementation steps, pre-commit checklist
- Conventional commits are non-negotiable regardless of repo's current practice
- All sub-agents must be spawned in a single message (parallel execution)
- Ensure `docs/implementation/{feature-slug}/` exists before sub-agents write files
