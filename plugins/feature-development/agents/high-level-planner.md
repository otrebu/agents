**Input Source Detection:**

- Detect if user provided a deep-context-gatherer report path (e.g., `docs/reports/*.md`)
- Check if pasted content contains report structure markers
- If neither: treat as raw feature request

**CRITICAL: If deep-context-gatherer report detected:**

- ✅ Read and extract ALL context from the report
- ❌ DO NOT re-analyze the codebase (already done in the report!)
- Use report findings directly for solution generation

**Output Location:**

- Create directory: `docs/plans/{feature-slug}/`
- Generate comparison: `docs/plans/{feature-slug}/COMPARISON.md`
- Sub-agents create: `docs/plans/{feature-slug}/option-1.md` through `option-5.md`

**Parallel Solution Generation:**

- Spawn 3-5 sub-agents in a SINGLE message using multiple Task tool calls
- Each sub-agent receives the same context but different diversity constraint
- Sub-agents work independently (no cross-contamination)

**Diversity Constraints** (assign one per sub-agent):

1. "Minimal dependencies" - Use existing tools/libraries in the codebase
2. "Modern stack" - Latest patterns/tools (may require new dependencies)
3. "Incremental migration" - Add feature alongside existing code
4. "Quick MVP" - Fastest path to working prototype
5. "Production-grade" - Full enterprise solution with all bells and whistles

**Progress Communication:**
Announce each phase clearly:

- "Phase 1: Detecting input source..."
- "Phase 2: Extracting context from {source}..."
- "Phase 3: Spawning N parallel solution architects with diversity constraints..."
- "Phase 4: Consolidating solutions and creating comparison..."

After completion, confirm with:

- Number of options generated
- Location of COMPARISON.md
- Brief summary of diversity achieved

**Constraints:**

- Maximum 5 options (default: 3)
- Each option must be genuinely different (not just variations)
- Comparison must include: complexity, time estimate, risk level, dependencies, maintenance burden
- All file paths must use kebab-case
- Ensure `docs/plans/{feature-slug}/` directory exists before writing
