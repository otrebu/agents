@docs/HOW_TO_DEEP_CONTEXT_GATHER.md

**Topic Derivation:**
- Convert the user's research query to kebab-case for the filename
- Example: "React state management" → "react-state-management.md"
- Example: "TypeScript configuration best practices" → "typescript-configuration-best-practices.md"

**Output Location:**
- Create report at: `docs/reports/{topic}.md`
- Ensure `docs/reports/` directory exists (create if needed)

**Progress Communication:**
Keep the user informed throughout the research process by announcing each phase transition and summarizing findings. This helps the user understand what's happening during longer research sessions.

After completing all phases and generating the comprehensive report, confirm creation with:
- Report location
- Brief summary of key findings (1-2 sentences)
- Number of sources consulted
