# My Claude Memory

A centralized configuration repository for Claude Code featuring:
- ðŸ¤– **10+ specialized agents** for code review, security analysis, architecture exploration
- âš¡ **Custom slash commands** for common workflows (commits, branches, code review)
- ðŸ”§ **Meta-command system** to create new commands following DRY principles
- ðŸ“Š **Multi-agent orchestration** for comprehensive codebase exploration
- ðŸ“š **Personal coding standards** (FP-first style, development workflow, tech stack preferences)
- ðŸ”— **Symlink-based setup** for easy sharing across projects

All configuration can be linked to your global Claude config (`~/.claude`) or individual project `.claude` folders.

## Setup: Linking to Your Projects

You can link this configuration to either your global Claude config (`~/.claude`) or individual project `.claude` folders.

### Quick Setup (Automated)

Use the provided setup script:

```bash
# For global configuration
./setup.sh --global

# For a specific project
./setup.sh --project ~/path/to/your-project

# Preview what would be done (dry run)
./setup.sh --global --dry-run
./setup.sh --project ~/path/to/your-project --dry-run

# Show help
./setup.sh --help
```

The script will:
- âœ“ Create `.claude` directory if needed
- âœ“ Create symlinks to agents, commands, settings
- âœ“ Use relative paths for project configs (portable)
- âœ“ Skip existing files/symlinks (safe to re-run)
- âœ“ Preview changes with `--dry-run` before applying

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to create symlinks manually:

**âœ… Recommended approach:**
1. **Navigate to** the `.claude` folder where you want to create the links
2. **Run `ln -s`** from that location
3. **Use relative paths** when possible (especially for project configs)

**Why this works:**
- Running from the target `.claude` folder makes the command consistent
- Relative paths are portable across different systems/users
- Easier to understand and maintain

#### Global Configuration (Manual)

Link to your global Claude config (`~/.claude`):

```bash
# Navigate to your global .claude folder
cd ~/.claude

# Create symlinks using relative paths
ln -s ~/dev/my-claude-memory/agents agents
ln -s ~/dev/my-claude-memory/commands commands
ln -s ~/dev/my-claude-memory/settings.json settings.json

# Optional: Link documentation
ln -s ~/dev/my-claude-memory/docs docs
ln -s ~/dev/my-claude-memory/CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md
```

#### Project-Specific Configuration (Manual)

Link to a specific project's `.claude` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to your project's .claude folder
cd ~/path/to/your-project/.claude

# Create symlinks using relative paths to this repository
# (adjust the path based on where my-claude-memory is relative to your project)
ln -s ../../my-claude-memory/agents agents
ln -s ../../my-claude-memory/commands commands
ln -s ../../my-claude-memory/settings.json settings.json
```

### Verifying Symlinks

Check that symlinks are created correctly:

```bash
ls -la ~/.claude          # for global config
# or
ls -la .claude            # for project config
```

You should see output like:
```
lrwxr-xr-x  agents -> ../agents
lrwxr-xr-x  commands -> ../commands
lrwxr-xr-x  settings.json -> ../settings.json
```

- Custom configurations

### Global Instructions (`/CLAUDE.md`)
Project context instructions that reference the documentation files.

## Key Features

### Command Creation System
The `/create-command` meta-command helps you build new custom commands following DRY principles. It supports two patterns:
- **Pattern A**: Standalone commands with inline documentation (for simple cases)
- **Pattern B**: Shared documentation with agent + command (for complex shared logic)

See `docs/HOW_TO_CREATE_COMMAND.md` for the complete pattern system and templates.

### Codebase Exploration
The `/explore-codebase` command orchestrates 6 specialized analysis agents to create comprehensive documentation:
1. Discovery â†’ Technology stack and project type
2. Architecture â†’ Structure, patterns, diagrams
3. Features â†’ Capabilities and user journeys
4. Technical â†’ Testing, CI/CD, quality
5. Security â†’ Vulnerabilities and recommendations
6. History â†’ Git evolution and patterns

Generates persistent documentation in `01-DISCOVERY.md`, `02-ARCHITECTURE.md`, `03-FEATURES.md`, `04-TECHNICAL.md`, `SECURITY_ANALYSIS.md`, `HISTORY_ANALYSIS.md`, and a main `CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`.

### Feature Branch Workflow
The `/start-feature` command creates feature branches following your project's naming conventions and development workflow guidelines.

## Updating Configuration

Since files are symlinked, any updates to this repository automatically reflect in all linked projects:

```bash
cd ~/dev/my-claude-memory
git pull origin main
# Changes are immediately available in all linked .claude folders
```
