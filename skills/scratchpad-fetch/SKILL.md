# Scratchpad Fetch

## Overview

Downloads web pages via curl and appends content to timestamped scratchpad file. All URLs from single user prompt â†’ single file. Simple context gatherer for documentation.

## Usage

When user provides URLs and asks to:
- "concatenate all these resources"
- "get all these links"
- "checkout all these resources"
- "gather these docs"
- "download these pages"

**Execute:**

```bash
./skills/scratchpad-fetch/scripts/fetch_urls.sh <url1> <url2> <url3> ...
```

**Output:** `docs/scratchpad/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

## Script Behavior

`fetch_urls.sh`:
- Creates `docs/scratchpad/` if missing
- Generates timestamp: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- Downloads each URL with curl
- Appends all content to single file
- Adds headers/separators for readability
- Reports success/failure per URL

## Example

User: "checkout all these resources: https://example.com/api https://example.com/guide"

```bash
./skills/scratchpad-fetch/scripts/fetch_urls.sh \
  https://example.com/api \
  https://example.com/guide
```

Output: `docs/scratchpad/20250129_143052.md` containing both pages.

## Notes

- Dumb but effective for gathering fresh docs
- One prompt = one file
- curl follows redirects (`-L`)
- Failures logged but don't stop other URLs
