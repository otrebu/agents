# Code Review

Expert code reviewer with automated pre-review checks (tests, linting, formatting) and optional auto-fix capabilities.

## Parameters

The skill accepts different modes and options:

- **mode**: `changes` | `target`
  - `changes`: Review uncommitted changes (git diff + status)
  - `target`: Review specific files/directories matching glob pattern

- **target**: File path or glob pattern (required if mode=target)
  - Examples: `src/auth`, `**/*.ts`, `lib/utils.ts`

- **intent**: Optional description or file reference
  - Plain text: `"add OAuth2 authentication"`
  - File reference: `@docs/requirements.md`
  - Used for Requirements Alignment section

- **save**: Boolean flag (--save)
  - If true: write review to `docs/CODE_REVIEW.md`
  - Default: show in chat only

## Process Workflow

### 1. Gather Code

**changes mode:**
```bash
git status
git diff HEAD
```

**target mode:**
- Use Glob to find files matching target pattern
- Read matched files
- Exit gracefully if nothing found

### 2. Load Intent (if provided)

- If starts with `@`: Read file at path
- Otherwise: use string as-is
- Store for Requirements Alignment section

### 3. Pre-Review Checks

Run [scripts/pre-review.sh](scripts/pre-review.sh) to check tests, linting, formatting:

```bash
bash scripts/pre-review.sh
```

**Exit codes** (bitwise OR):
- `0`: All passed → proceed to review
- `1`: Lint failed → auto-fix
- `2`: Format failed → auto-fix
- `4`: Tests failed → auto-fix
- `8`: No package.json → skip to review

**Handle failures:**

Exit code 8 (no package.json):
- Skip all checks
- Proceed directly to review

Exit code 1 (lint failed):
- Spawn Task with fix-eslint skill
- Wait for completion
- If auto-fix fails or times out, note the failure and proceed to review anyway
- Re-run pre-review.sh once. If still failing after the second run, proceed to review and note failures in output

Exit code 2 (format failed):
- Run `pnpm format` directly
- Re-run pre-review.sh once. If still failing after the second run, proceed to review and note failures in output

Exit code 4 (tests failed):
- Spawn Task: "Fix failing tests - review test output and fix the code to make tests pass"
- Wait for completion
- If auto-fix fails or times out, note the failure and proceed to review anyway
- Re-run pre-review.sh once. If still failing after the second run, proceed to review and note failures in output

Multiple failures (e.g., 7 = lint + format + tests):
- Handle in sequence: format first, then lint, then tests
- Re-run checks after each fix

**Max attempts:**
- Limit to 2 full pre-review cycles (1 initial run + 1 retry)
- If checks still fail after second run, proceed to review anyway
- Note failures in review output

### 4. Execute Review

Follow [methodology.md](methodology.md) for complete review process and output format.

**Process:**
1. Scan for critical safety/security issues
2. Verify tests & edge cases
3. If intent provided: validate implementation accomplishes goals
4. Note improvements & positives
5. Summarize decision with next steps

**Output format:** Use exact headings from [methodology.md](methodology.md):
- **Critical Issues** - with line numbers (L42, L42-47, file.ts:42)
- **Functional Gaps** - missing tests/handling
- **Requirements Alignment** - only if intent provided
- **Improvements Suggested**
- **Positive Observations**
- **Overall Assessment** - Approve | Request Changes | Comment Only

### 5. Present Review

Always show review in chat, formatted with markdown headings.

### 6. Save (if requested)

If save=true:
- Use Write tool to create/overwrite `docs/CODE_REVIEW.md`
- Include all sections with exact headings
- Preserve markdown formatting

## Examples

**Review uncommitted changes:**
```
mode: changes
intent: null
save: false
```

**Review with intent:**
```
mode: changes
intent: "Implement OAuth2 authentication with secure token storage"
save: false
```

**Review specific files:**
```
mode: target
target: "src/auth/**/*.ts"
intent: "security review"
save: true
```

**Review with file-based requirements:**
```
mode: changes
intent: "@docs/requirements/auth.md"
save: true
```

## Notes

- Use this skill immediately after writing or modifying code
- Gracefully handles projects without package.json (skips checks)
- Auto-fixes: delegates to fix-eslint skill for lint errors, runs pnpm format for format errors
- Intent can be plain text or file reference with @ prefix
- Re-runs checks after auto-fixes, max 2 cycles
- Pre-review script ([scripts/pre-review.sh](scripts/pre-review.sh)) returns bitwise exit codes: 1=lint, 2=format, 4=test, 8=no package.json
